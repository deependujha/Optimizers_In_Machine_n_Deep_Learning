# Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) üíπ

## Overview

`EWMA is a statistical method used to analyze and smooth out time series data to identify trends over a certain period while giving more weight to recent observations.`

- **`It assigns exponentially decreasing weights as observations get older, with the most recent observations carrying more significance.`**

## Formula

The formula for calculating EWMA is:

$$ S_t = \alpha \times Y_t + (1 - \alpha) \times S_{t-1} $$

Some replace $(1 - \alpha)$ with $(\beta)$.

$$ S_t = (1 - \beta) \times Y_t + \beta \times S_{t-1} $$

Where:
- $S_t$ = EWMA at time 't'
- $Y_t$ = Observation at time 't'
- $\alpha$ = Smoothing factor (0 < $\alpha$ ‚â§ 1)
- $\beta$ = Decaying factor (0 < $\beta$ ‚â§ 1)

The smoothing factor $\alpha$ determines the rate of decay of the older observations' influence on the average.

- **A smaller $\alpha$ assigns more weight to older observations, whereas a larger $\alpha$ gives more weight to recent data**.

- **A larger $\beta$ assigns more weight to older observations, whereas a smaller $\beta$ gives more weight to recent data**.

### Example:

>
> let data = [1, 2, 3]
> alpha = 0.5
> So, ewma_data = [1, 1.5, 2.25]

### Intuition of $\beta$ üòà

For intuition of beta, you can think of it as an average of last X days.

$$ previous (X) = 1 / (1 - \beta) $$

- If $\beta$ is 0.9, means, current days value depends on last 10 days values.

- $\beta$ = 0.98, means takes average of last 50 days. Someone's todays happiness depends on experiences of last 50 days, means very stable emotions. Neither too happy nor too sad.

- $\beta$ = 0.1, means takes average of last 1 day. Someone's todays happiness depends on experiences of yesterday or today only, means very moody. Sometimes, too happy, sometimes too sad.

- **Generally, $\beta$ = 0.9 is taken as default.**

### But, how can we say if today's EWMA depends on previous EWMA?

## Properties

- **Adaptability**: EWMA adapts quickly to changes in data patterns due to the higher emphasis on recent observations.
- **Constant Memory**: It requires storing only the previous EWMA value and the current observation.
- **Parameter Selection**: The choice of $\( \alpha \)$ affects the responsiveness of the EWMA to changes in the data.

## Usage

EWMA finds applications in:
- **Finance**: Predicting trends in stock prices, volatility analysis.
- **Quality Control**: Monitoring production processes by smoothing out variations.
- **Signal Processing**: Noise reduction in signal data.

- **Deep learning optimizers**

## Implementation in python üêç

### Python Example

```python
import pandas as pd

# Creating a dummy dataset
data = [1, 2, 3]

# Creating a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=["Values"])

# Calculating EWMA with alpha = 0.5
ALPHA = 0.5
ewma = df.ewm(alpha=ALPHA, adjust=False).mean()
# to know about (adjust=False), 
# visit here: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.ewm.html


my_ewma = [0.0 for _ in range(len(data))]

for i, curr_data in enumerate(data):
    if i == 0:
        my_ewma[i] = curr_data
    else:
        my_ewma[i] = ((1 - ALPHA) * my_ewma[i - 1]) + ((ALPHA) * curr_data)

print(data)
print(ewma)
print(my_ewma)

```

## Bias Correction üë®üèª‚Äçüíº

- If we take $\beta = 0.9$, it means on an intuitive level to be taking average of last 10 data points.

- We also assume, $S_{t-1}$ to be equal to 0. And hence, our $S_{t=1}$ comes to be $0.1 * Y_t$, which is very below actual $Y_t$ at time t=0.

- Although, this difference is going to be fixed when we reach after starting first 10 data points. From then on, it will be indeed carrying weighted average of last 10 data points.

- But, if we want to also fix the bias that we have to make at the starting by taking $S_{t=0} = 0$, we can do so by:

$$ \hat{S_t} = \frac{S_t}{1 - \beta^{epoch}} $$

- `t` is the epoch number **(we are raising power of Beta by the epoch number**).
